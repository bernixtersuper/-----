    <h1>Manga</h1>
    <p>Here are some websites i have used to read manga in japanese online as well as download it and read it offline. If you want to read manga in a mobile device i highly recommend checking out:</p>
    <h3>Tachiyomi</h3>
    <p>Its an android app that allows you to read manga from different sources, you can download the manga and read it offline, i recommend using the local source option. Theres a guide on Tachiyomi's website on how to set up different types of files but basically you are gonna need to hava a folder named Tachiyomi and in it another one called local, here you can store folders with the chapters/volumes of the manga you downloaded from nyaa.si or mangazip and keep track of your progress.</p>
    <h3>Downloading Manga</h3>
    <p>When it comes to downloading manga Nyaa.si is the best website i have found, it has a huge selection of not only manga but also anime and books. You can download the manga and read it offline with a manga reader like Tachiyomi or OpenComic. To download the contents you are gonna need a torrent client like qBittorrent, otherwise you can use another source like mangazip that lets you download manga through downloaders like sakurafile or rapidgator</p>
    <h3>Online readers</h3>
    <p>For online casual reading any online reading website listed below will do the job just fine, Just make sure to have an adblock installed on your browser for the best experience.</p>
