        <h1>アニメ (Anime)</h1>
        <p>Here are some websites i have used to watch anime online as well as download it and watch it offline. If you are just starting out i recommend:</p>
        <h3>Animelon</h3>
        <p>Animelon is your best choice if you want to start watching anime in japanese since its oriented towards learners and the website provides different tools like scanning subtitles and adding multiple subtitles simultaneously. The main benefit of animelon is that you dont need any add-on or app, you can get straight to watching.</p><p>Animelon has a limited selection of anime and is very lacking in customization but if you enjoy the way it works you should definitely consider Yomitan and asbplayer to upgrade your experience</p>
        <h2>Best way of watching anime
        </h2>
        <p> The best way of watching anime i have come up with has a few requirements but its ultimately the best. You are gonna need:
        <h3>Yomitan</h3>
        <p>An OCR text scanner that has anki compatibility and works with different japanese dicitionaries, its basically a little dictionary that scans the words you hover over and displays the words reading and meaning. You can also add the words to anki for later review</p>
        <h3>asbplayer</h3>
        <p>A web based video player that displays OCR (Yomitan) scannable subtitles over any video, you can feed it your subtitles or extract them from the video source. You can also install the chrome extension and display subtitles over any video (Netflix, 9anime, etc.). The subtitles are highly customizable (i recommend using the font "Yu mincho")</p>
        <h3>Anki</h3>
        <p>Anki is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you remember things. You can use it to review the words you scanned with Yomitan after linking them you can create flashcards with the click of a button.</p>
        <h3>Downloading anime</h3>
        <p>When it comes to downloading anime Nyaa.si is the best website i have found, it has a huge selection of not only anime but also manga and books. You can download the anime and watch it offline with a video player like asbplayer. To download the contents you are gonna need a torrent client like qBittorrent, otherwise you can use another source like subsplease that lets you download anime directly. Then you can get the appropiate subtitles from kitsunekko or jimaku depending on how new the anime is.</p>
